## Installation ##
Installing phpLiterAdmin is pretty easy and there is not much to do. If you do need help you can follow these instructions.

1) **Download** [Download the latest](http://code.google.com/p/phpliteradmin/downloads/list) (The latest and stable versions will have tags of Latest and Stable)

2) **Upload** it to your web server or where ever you want to use phpLiterAdmin. Usually best to upload it to the directory where your SQLite databases are located, or near by ;)

3) **Edit** the $config variables to your liking, these are all at the beginning (or near by) of the file, and have information about what they do, but you can see a more descriptive list on the config vars Wiki Page. (Coming Soon!)

4) **Use it!** Once you have edited the variables to your liking, such as the users array, just access the phpliteradmin.php file in your browser on your web server, login, and use it!

Enjoy!
