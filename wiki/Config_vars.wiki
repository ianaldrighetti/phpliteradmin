==Config vars==
When [http://code.google.com/p/phpliteradmin/wiki/Installation installing] phpLiterAdmin there are some $config variables that need editing, or at least, that you should edit ;) Though each variable has a little description near it, you can find more information about it here.

===Setting up users===
{{{
array $config['users']
}}}
With phpLiterAdmin you can have multiple users which can access your SQLite databases. The setup is very simple... For example, if you want to have a user with the username of TESTING and the password of PASSWORD it would look like this:
  {{{
    $config['users'] = array(
      'TESTING' => 'PASSWORD',
    );
  }}}

You can of course have multiple users by adding another row to the array like:
  {{{
    $config['users'] = array(
      'TESTING' => 'PASSWORD',
      'ANOTHER_USER' => 'PASSWORD_FOR_ANOTHER_USER',
    );
  }}}
*NOTE*: Usernames and passwords _are_ case-sensitive.
